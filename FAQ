Q1. I get an error when producing the SVG files (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04). E.g. "Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0/GD/SVG.pm line 1120."

A: "Get more recent versions of the GD and GD::SVG [perl] libraries and the problem will be solved. I am using GD 2.39 and GD::SVG 0.33"
--Lincoln D. Stein

A: Alexie:
I still have these issues with GD 2.56 and GD::SVG 0.33
ERROR, thread [..] exited with error Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at /usr/local/share/perl/5.18.2/GD/SVG.pm line 1120, <STATSIN> line 2."
Troubleshooting:
It seems that Bio::Graphics::Glyph::xyplot::
_draw_boxes make a call to
GD::SVG with a very high integer value
*1073742019 at /usr/local/share/perl/5.14.2/GD/SVG.pm line 1120.*
    GD::SVG::Image::_get_color('GD::SVG::Image=HASH(0x39be900)',
The problem seems to lie here:
  # Make the boxes transparent
  my $positive = $self->pos_color + 1073741824;
  my $negative = $self->neg_color + 1073741824;
What is the purpose of adding 1073741824 ? There isn't an color index above
200 when i dump the GD object. It seems that this integer addition is
mainly for PNG formats and transparency? If I remove this addition, then
the SVG works fine and the image is correct

Solution:
edit
Bio/Graphics/Glyph/xyplot.pm
And add ;# as below at line 314 and 315
  my $positive = $self->pos_color;# + 1073741824;
  my $negative = $self->neg_color;# + 1073741824;
